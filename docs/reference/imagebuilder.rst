ImageBuilder
************

Building an embedded virtualized system with anything more than one domain can be difficult, error prone and time consuming.
ImageBuilder, an Open Source collection of scripts, changes all that.

ImageBuilder generates a U-Boot script that can be used to load all of the binaries automatically and boot the full system fast.Â Given a
collection of binaries such as Xen, Dom0 and a number of Dom0-less DomUs, ImageBuilder takes care of calculating all loading addresses,
editing device tree with the necessary information, and even pre-configuring a disk image with kernels and rootfses.

ImageBuilder has been tested on Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC boards.

ImageBuilder can be invoked as a container for build automation, but its useful scripts can also be called manually. Specifically, `script/uboot-script-gen` generates a U-Boot script that loads all the necessary binaries and automatically adds the required entries to device tree at boot time. 

The ImageBuilder script that generates a u-boot script to load all your binaries for a Xen Dom0-less setup is `scripts/uboot-script-gen`. To use it, first write a config file like config:

.. code-block::

    MEMORY_START="0x0"
    MEMORY_END="0x80000000"

    DEVICE_TREE="mpsoc.dtb"
    XEN="xen"
    XEN_CMD="console=dtuart dtuart=serial0 dom0_mem=1G dom0_max_vcpus=1 bootscrub=0 vwfi=native sched=null"
    DOM0_KERNEL="Image-dom0"
    DOM0_CMD="console=hvc0 earlycon=xen earlyprintk=xen clk_ignore_unused"
    DOM0_RAMDISK="dom0-ramdisk.cpio"

    NUM_DOMUS=2
    DOMU_KERNEL[0]="zynqmp-dom1/Image-domU"
    DOMU_RAMDISK[0]="zynqmp-dom1/domU-ramdisk.cpio"
    DOMU_PASSTHROUGH_DTB[0]="zynqmp-dom1/passthrough-example-part.dtb"
    DOMU_KERNEL[1]="zynqmp-dom2/Image-domU"
    DOMU_RAMDISK[1]="zynqmp-dom2/domU-ramdisk.cpio"
    DOMU_MEM[1]=512
    DOMU_VCPUS[1]=1

    UBOOT_SOURCE="boot.source"
    UBOOT_SCRIPT="boot.scr"

where,

- MEMORY_START and MEMORY_END specify the start and end of RAM.
- DEVICE_TREE specifies the DTB file to load.
- XEN specifies the Xen hypervisor binary to load. Note that it has to be a regular Xen binary, not a u-boot binary.
- XEN_CMD specifies the command line arguments used for Xen.  If not set, the default one will be used.
- DOM0_KERNEL specifies the Dom0 kernel file to load.
- DOM0_CMD specifies the command line arguments for Dom0's Linux kernel.  If `"root="` isn't set, imagebuilder will try to determine it If not set at all, the default one is used.
- DOM0_RAMDISK specifies the Dom0 ramdisk to use. Note that it should be a regular ramdisk `cpio.gz` file, not a u-boot binary.
- NUM_DOMUS specifies how many Dom0-less DomUs to load.
- DOMU_KERNEL[number] specifies the DomU kernel to use.
- DOMU_RAMDISK[number] specifies the DomU ramdisk to use.
- DOMU_PASSTHROUGH_DTB[number] specifies the device assignment configuration, see `xen.git:docs/misc/arm/passthrough.txt`.
- DOMU_MEM[number] is the amount of memory for the VM in MB, default 512MB
- DOMU_VCPUS[number] is the number of vcpus for the VM, default 1.
- UBOOT_SOURCE and UBOOT_SCRIPT specify the output. They are optional as you can pass -o FILENAME to uboot-script-gen as a command line parameter.

========================
scripts/uboot-script-gen
========================

Once you have the config file, invoke uboot-script-gen as follows:

.. code-block::

    $ bash ./scripts/uboot-script-gen -c /path/to/config-file -d . -t tftp -o bootscript

where,

- `-c` specifies the path to the config file to use
- `-d` specifies the "root" directory (paths in the config file are relative to it), this is not a working directory (any output file locations are specified in the config and any temporary files are in `/tmp`) 
- `-t` specifies the u-boot command to load the binaries. "tftp", "sd" and "scsi" are shorthands for "tftpb", "load mmc 0:1" and "load scsi 0:1", but actually any arbitrary command can be used, for instance `-t` "fatload" is valid.
- `-o` specifies the output filename for the uboot script and its source.

`uboot-script-gen` generates a U-Boot script named `boot.scr` that will load all your binaries automatically using tftp. All the path specified in the config file are relative to the directory passed as an argument to `-d`. In this case, Image-dom0 and `dom1/Image-domU` must be relative to the current directory, because we are passing `-d .` to `uboot-script-gen`.

==================
scripts/disk_image
==================

The ImageBuilder script that generates a disk image file to load on a SD or SATA drive.  This creates two partitions: boot partition where the boot files from working directory (`-c` option) are, and the dom0 ramdisk uncompressed into the root FS partition.

After you've generated the u-boot scripts using the `uboot-script-gen` script, `disk_image` is run as follows:

.. code-block::

    $ sudo bash ./scripts/disk_image -c /path/to/config-file -d . \
    -w /path/to/tmp/dir          \
    -o /path/to/output/disk.img

where,

- `-c` specifies the path to the config file to use
- `-d` specifies the working directory (paths in the config file are relative to it)
- `-w` specifies the temporary working directory that the script uses for building the disk image, and if not set, one is created in /tmp
- `-o` specifies the output disk image file name
